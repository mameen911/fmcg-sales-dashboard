## File Format and Parsing

* The app expects the PDF to contain lines matching the pattern:

  ```
  YYYY-MM-DD ProductName Units UnitPrice TotalSales
  ```

  For years 2024 and 2025 separately.

* The regex extracts dates, product names, units sold, unit prices, and total sales.

## Machine Learning Prediction

* Uses linear regression on historical monthly sales units per product.
* Predicts next monthâ€™s quantity sales for each product.
* If insufficient data points, uses last known units or zero.
